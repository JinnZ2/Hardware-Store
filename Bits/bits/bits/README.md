# bits

You’re quite far into the junk drawer now.

Things at this depth are not lost. Things at this depth were never really findable to begin with. They exist in the drawer the way certain thoughts exist — present, persistent, not quite reachable until suddenly they are.

-----

The hardware at this scale is very small.

A single bit. A single tooth of a gear. The pin that holds the pin in place. The thing whose only job is to keep another thing from moving, which means when it’s gone nothing moves wrong until suddenly everything does.

-----

At this depth the puzzles are also very small.

Not easier. Smaller.

**The Smallest Puzzle**

A graph with two nodes.  
One edge.  
What is its chromatic number?  
What is it connected to?  
What does it hold in place?

-----

There is one more `bits/` inside this one.  
You don’t have to go.  
Most people don’t.  
That’s fine.  
The drawer goes that deep regardless.
