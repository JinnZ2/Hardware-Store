# bits

You found the junk drawer inside the junk drawer.

This happens. You’re looking for something in the junk drawer and you find a smaller container — an altoids tin, a film canister, a ziplock bag — and inside that smaller container is more stuff. Smaller stuff. The stuff that was too small even for the junk drawer proper.

Things that live at this scale:

- The screw that fell off something and you don’t know what
- The battery that might still have charge
- The key that opens something you no longer own
- The note you wrote to yourself that says only “CHECK THIS”
- The thing that is clearly important but you cannot remember why

-----

All of these are also puzzles.

The screw that fell off something: what did it hold together? What is now slightly loose somewhere in your life?

The battery: Schrödinger’s battery. Charge unknown until measured. Useful and useless simultaneously.

The key: a solution without a problem. Or a problem without a known lock.

The note: `CHECK THIS` — *check what?* You knew when you wrote it. The context decayed. The instruction remains.

The important thing: you recognize importance without being able to articulate it. That recognition is data. What is it pointing at?

These are not rhetorical questions.  
They are the hardware store’s smallest inventory.  
Stock: unknown.  
Location: here, probably.

There is another `bits/` folder inside this one.  
It is smaller.  
Everything scales.

  The five items listed above (screw, battery, key, note, important thing)
  are nodes in a graph.
  
  Draw edges between any two nodes that share a property.
  What is the chromatic number of your graph?
  
  Compare to PUZZLE-003 in pipe_connect_042.json.
  Compare to PUZZLE-META-001 in puzzles/README.md.
  
  The chromatic number keeps appearing.
  This is not a coincidence.
  What is it encoding?
