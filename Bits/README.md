# Bits

You found the junk drawer.

Every hardware store has one. It’s not on the map. It’s not in the aisle directory. It’s the place where things end up that don’t have a place yet, or had a place once and lost it, or belong somewhere specific but nobody remembers where.

This is that place.

-----

The inventory is in here. The real inventory. The aisles have signs but the parts are here, in the drawer, where things actually live.

You’ll also find other things. That’s the nature of junk drawers. You come in looking for a bolt and you leave with three bolts, a mystery washer, something that might be a puzzle, and a question you didn’t have when you arrived.

The `bits/` folder at the bottom of this list is smaller.  
Junk drawers scale down.  
This is known.
