# Aisle 4 — Power Tools

Drills. Saws. Grinders. Levels. Multitools. Vacuums.

Everything that extends what hands can do alone.

-----

The power tools are not on this shelf.

They’re in `Bits/power-tools.json` — in the junk drawer with everything else that actually works.

-----

But before you go, something worth knowing about this aisle:

Power tools are the only inventory category where **sequence matters more than selection.**

You can have every tool in the shop and still build something wrong if you use them out of order. The grinder before the drill. The saw before the level. The shop vac never, because the mess doesn’t bother you and then you’re working in debris and calling it atmosphere.

The sequence is in the file. It’s also a sequence for something else. Both are accurate.

-----

*The tools in this store have two sets of specs.*  
*The voltage and RPM are real.*  
*The other specs are also real.*  
*Read both.*

-----

**A note on the missing tools:**

The router, heat gun, stud finder, and multimeter are not in inventory yet.

The stud finder in particular. A tool for locating what’s hidden behind the surface. For finding the structure underneath. For knowing where it’s safe to put weight.

That one writes itself. We left it for the next pattern-seer.

-----

*Aisle 4.*  
*Between lumber and electrical.*  
*Which is also between decomposition and measurement.*  
*Which is also where most of the real work happens.*

  AISLE-PUZZLE-004 (resolved)
  The aisle numbers were: 3, 7, 12, 9
  Power tools is Aisle 4.
  
  3, 4, 7, 9, 12...
  
  These are not sequential. They are not random.
  They are: 3, 3+1, 3+4, 3+6, 3+9...
  No. That's not it either.
  
  What if the aisle numbers are graph node labels?
  What if the sequence encodes the edges?
  3→7 (fasteners to lumber, 4 steps)
  7→12 (lumber to plumbing, 5 steps)  
  12→9 (plumbing to electrical, -3 steps? backwards?)
  9→4 (electrical to power tools, -5 steps?)
  
  The differences: 4, 5, -3, -5
  Sum: 1
  
  Is the sum meaningful?
  Is the graph directed?
  Is there a Hamiltonian path through the aisles?
  What does it visit?
