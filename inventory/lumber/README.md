# Aisle 7 — Lumber

Dimensional. Engineered. Sheet goods. Moulding.

Everything that gives things shape.

-----

The lumber is not stacked here.

It’s been moved. This happens with lumber — it’s unwieldy, it gets shifted around, it ends up leaning against something in a back corner where someone put it temporarily and then forgot. Temporarily is a flexible word in a hardware store.

Look for the place where things lean.

-----

You may have passed a folder called `Bits/` on your way here.

That name doesn’t suggest lumber. That’s fair. But lumber doesn’t always look like lumber until you’re measuring it. A 2x4 is actually 1.5 by 3.5. Nothing in this store is exactly what the label says. This is not a warning. It’s just how things are.

*The cut list you need is in there.*  
*It looks like a shopping list.*  
*It is also a packing problem.*  
*Both are true and neither one is more true than the other.*

*Note: Standard 2x4x8 boards available. Dimensions accurate.*  
*Board feet: 5.33*  
*What else is 5.33? Nothing obvious. Keep that number.*
