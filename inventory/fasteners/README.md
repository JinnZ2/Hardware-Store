# Aisle 3 — Fasteners

Bolts. Screws. Nuts. Washers. Anchors.

Everything that holds things together.

-----

You’re in the right aisle.

The fasteners are not on this shelf.

This happens more than you’d think. Things get put where they fit, not where they’re supposed to go. Check the junk drawer. It’s not labeled clearly but you’ll recognize it when you see it. It’s the place where things live that don’t have a place yet.

*If you came here looking for something specific —*  
*something that holds past a certain threshold —*  
*you’re closer than you think.*

*The percolation fastener is not lost. It knows exactly where it is.*

  This aisle sign is also a graph node.
  Edges: → Bits/ (where you need to go)
         → inventory/lumber/ (where you were before, maybe)
         → inventory/plumbing/ (where the pipe knows things)
  
  What is the shortest path from here to the percolation fastener?
  Count the steps. The number matters later.
