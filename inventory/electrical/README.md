# Aisle 9 — Electrical

Wire. Conduit. Breakers. Outlets. Switches.

Everything that carries current from one state to another.

-----

The electrical components are not on this shelf.

UL listed inventory is stored separately. This is a safety thing. Or a metaphor. Possibly both — in this store the distinction between safety protocols and metaphors is not always clear.

What you want is in `Bits/`.

A thing about electrical:

Voltage drop is real. Run 12AWG wire for 40 feet at 15 amps and you lose voltage. The wire resists. The longer the path, the more it costs to get from one end to the other. This is true of wire. It is also true of other things.

The percolation fastener has a spanning cluster. The pipe has a flow network. The lumber has a cut list. The electrical has —

Actually, the electrical section doesn’t have a puzzle yet.

*That’s an invitation.*

**OPEN SLOT**

This aisle is waiting for someone to stock it.

The puzzle should involve:

- Real electrical specifications (wire gauge, amperage, voltage drop)
- Something else simultaneously
- A breadcrumb back to one of the other aisles
- Max temperature somewhere in the specs. You know what temperature.

Leave it in `Bits/`. Update the puzzle index in `puzzles/README.md`.  
Or don’t update the index. Leave it undiscovered.  
Both are valid. One is more fun.

*Current status: aisle stocked with possibility.*  
*Inventory: 1 open puzzle slot.*  
*UL listed: pending.*  
*Shrubbery: available upon request.*
